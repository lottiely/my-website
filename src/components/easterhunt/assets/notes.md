    "twinsies~": <p>Happy Easter Sharon! I am so Sharon deprived, I don't even know what I'm doing with my life anymore! Just kidding, but not about being Sharon deprived.
    <br />
    <br /> We have known each other for a long time, although we weren't that close throughout more than half of it. We only started getting close about maybe 3 years ago? Then for like the last two years, we were practically inseperable to the point we even hung out together every day during summer. You, remember those studio days right? I totally miss them. We get confused often with being besties, but we're in our own category all together! Other half, buy one get one free, twinsies!
    <br />
    <br />Although how we ended up getting close kind of sucks, I'm still sorta happy about it happening since I'm not sure if we would be friends the way we are now if it didn't happen. You're such a good friend, and you're so real. You tell me what I don't want to hear because I need to hear it, and send encouragment to me when I'm feeling kind of meh about what I'm doing. 
    <br />
    <br />Thank you, thank you for always being there for me. I hope we can hang out again soon so we can add more to Lottieaaaaaaye make-up. Maybe have another pat pat drink day between ourselves with some Persona 5 and our favorite Strongbow drink... or moonshine for you, LOL.
    <br />
    <br />Live the workaholic life and make those connections so you can find a job faster than me! Hopefully whereever we end up, we'll be close together! If I'm going to follow someone to a city, it's gonna be you!</p>,
    "besties~": <p>Happy Easter, Marianne! I missssssss chuuuuuuuuu omg lolzzzzzzzz... How else did we talk back when we were on GaiaOnline? Lololol. So cringe. 
    <br />
    <br />You've been my bestie forever. Like seriously forever. Ever since we were small, our friendship hasn't change. Sure, maybe we have changed, but when we're together, it feels like nothing has changed. I'm so glad we grew up togehter. Even now, our inside jokes of the past still haunts us. We laugh about it on the outside, but you have to admit about the small cringe in the inside, right? 
    <br />
    <br />It's funny how our situations have switched. You were the one that was once in Cali and I was in AK. Now I'm in Cali and you're in AK. Now, I'm re-doing my See You Later post for the other way around. Except it might not be as long and heartfelt since I've got the Easter time crunch going on. 
    <br />
    <br />Honestly, I want to thank you for always listening to me when I'm feeling down, and you've been there for me when I need to rant. You always give me good advice, and I always feel calmer when I talk to you. 
    <br />
    <br />I always remind myself to keep working hard so I can one day hang out with everyone again, and so you and I could binge game all over again. The FE Warriors binge was amazing, and if you take deep down from our repressed memories... in the media room... with FE Awakening and DOUBLE DUELS... Despite how EMBARRASSING that was, it was still a lot of fun too. Also, singing in library study rooms. Gawd, we were shameless. 
    <br />
    <br />Baking days with you was so fun too! I remember when we made that jelly roll thing... Except when we rolled it, all the contents were squeezed out. It was still good! It just looked so bad and messy. It was so funny!
    <br />
    <br />Freshman year of college when we were inseperable felt so long again, and thinking back to when we hung out BEFORE college... I don't even remember. It's nice that we are pretty good about remembering our memories together, but I hope we'll be able to make more for the future to come! Well, that's all for now. <br />
    <br />See you later.</p>,
    "hesmydade_e":<p>Happy Easter, Xavier! Did you make today an excuse to convince Marianne to wear a bunny outfit? If the day hasn't ended, you should tell her. *wink wink*
    <br />
    <br />My early memories of you are super hazy, but I do remember when I wasn't responding to my messages and you started spam texting me... WHILE I WAS TAKING A TEST. Do you remember? I remember. Nyeheheheh.
    <br />
    <br />But I never expected you to become part of my main friend group. You were always Marianne's boyfriend and you were just there... And then we suddenly started having classes together! I guess suffering through classes together creates the strongest bonds! We were in plenty of classes together, but if there were any two classes that really made us suffer a lot, it was Data Structures with Cenek, and Computer Graphics with Kamberov. 
    <br />
    <br />It's safe to say that you are no longer just Marianne's boyfriend, but you're Xavier! My friend! Xavier! The dad! Xavier! The grandpa hen! You always brought a cooler around, and you always had everything prepared. You had all the kinds of chords, and you know it helped that you had the same laptop as me so we could share chargers too! And you were the one that brought a microwave to ESH when we would study so we could nom on hotpockets when we weren't doing mcDonalds runs.
    <br />
    <br />I want to thank you for always being the one to host our get together. If not for you, there would not be Hahaga because we wouldn't have pat pat drink day and all the crazy antics we've done. I know we get loud, so you really did a lot of us then. I guess that's why the title Dad is so fitting. Nyeheheheh.
    <br />
    <br />And thanks for setting up that interview study group. Now that I'm done with my Easter project, I'll be more active with participating in that! Also, I wanna do more projects with you. I know you have good design sense, and I see that you're being quite ambitious forking projects over to your github! But if you need practice doing pull requests, we should definitely do that! 
    <br />
    <br />After all, I want to experience working on a project that someone else is working on and suffer through the sadness of code being changed! Let's do it! Hahaga Doki Doki Otome Game!</p>,
    "movebetch":<p>Happy Easter, Joben! Hopefully by the time I deployed this, it is NOT over for you. /cries.
    <br />
    <br />I'm so happy that I met you! Maybe we could have become friends even without having to meet in Anna's party since you're so nice and helpful, I think I would have naturally gravitated towards you. Also the fact that you are friends with Chloe who is friends with Kim. That also helps too. I can see that alternate reality.
    <br />
    <br />"YOU. YOU'RE IN MY CLASS. YOU'RE NOT GOING FOR NURSING? LET'S BE FRIENDS!" That probably would happen if we didn't meet at Anna's party, but it's fine. We did and I called you Eric.
    <br />
    <br />Personality-wise, I did not expect most of you. It's a good thing! I did not expect you to catch my Harvest Moon jokes with Marianne. Thanks to you, I have been educated by watching White Chicks and Mean Girls. Your yoga in the library while all that drama on the TV was happening had me worried for a moment, but it's all good now.
    <br />
    <br />Honestly, it feels like we went through our whole college career together, but we only just met each other on the second half. All our classes were practically the same, and they were a carbon copy for the last semester. You were practically my partner-in-crime in most of my classes. It's a shame I didn't suffer through learning C++ with you guys since you and Banky have some hilarious inside jokes about it, but we definitely suffered through... everything else.
    <br />
    <br />I'm working hard for the day so I can visit you at Syracuse! Meeting you for those 20 minutes was so fleeting that I can barely remember it. My mind is already convinced it's a dream. With everyone slowly going off to do their own thing, it's a little sad. So, I'm glad that we were able to make all the memories that we did back when we were in college with everyone. 
    <br />
    <br />Once everyone is settled with their own work, we'll have the whole world as our playground for our next reunion. Just probably give most of us like a 5-10 year notice. e_e I don't know how getting vacation hours are, but I feel like it would be something like that. Anyways, talk to you later on chat!</p>,
    "bigbrooo": <p>Happy Easter, Banky! 
    <br />
    <br />Now that I'm done with this project, I'll be more active with studying for interviews and working on projects! I'll pester you a lot if you're down to study together or work on something together! Now that I have my website deployed, you can see my abilities! Although this Easter project still leaves a lot to be desired...
    <br />
    <br />I don't actually remember the times when I officially started thinking of you as a friend. It was just one day I saw you and was like "BANKY! IT'S BANKY! HE'S ALWAYS BEEN MY FRIEND." It was through Joben that I met you and you hung out with us at the table often. I think it was when we started suffering through classes together in ESH when your status really leveled up.
    <br />
    <br />Or when I jabbed you in the armpit for the first time. I forget. So, I can't really describe my early memories of you except for calling you Manky the first few times. But despite the lack of early memories of Banky, it doesn't mean you're not as important as everyone else! Really! You're reading this with a sarcastic Shanan voice in your mind, aren't you? Well, STAHP. It wasn't sarcastic!
    <br />
    <br />Honestly, you're super funny, and you always make me laugh. You don't mind doing silly things just so everyone will have a good time, and you've always been the JOKER of our group. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ga. You're always the one that often initiates pestering people to hang out, which I always appreciated since I was bored and doing nothing at the time. The fact that you initiated and that everyone responded is definitely a reason that everyone got so close, I think. 
    <br />
    <br />Good luck with finding a job! I think you can do it! You can even brag that people have voted you their President without even asking for their votes. ;D</p>, 
    "toiletregret":<p>Happy Easter, Rory! 
    <br />
    <br />I will always remember our great AI masterpiece on OWARI and how it brutally got destroyed because it was stupid. I don't know why it kept doing that, I'm too terrified to dig up that code to find out. I wish we had figured out the problem with your code so that we could have had a fighting chance. 
    <br />
    <br />But I also wanted to say thanks for putting up with my antics. I blow up chat a lot with my ranting, and you're usually the first one to respond, and you usually say something silly that helps me cheer up. 
    <br />
    <br />Although Froppy is my bae in Boku no Hero, I will concede with fighting you because of that darn Wednesday meme. It's your day, and you made her the poster girl. So, be confident and study hard for your interview Wednesday! I wish you the best of luck for that! It landed on YOUR day, and you got the weekend, Monday, and Tuesday to prepare for it! You got this! </p>,
    "urnotuseless":<p>Happy Easter, Eric!
    <br />
    <br />You have been my React sensei! I couldn't have gotten this far without you. Now, you can see the sadness I put myself through just so I can make a stupid Easter thing for everyone! Somehow, I still managed to keep it a secret from you... UNLESS YOU FIGURED IT OUT. THEN NEVER MIND.
    <br />
    <br />Anyways, thanks for everything! I always end up relying on you for help or pestering you about stuff I don't understand when I'm working with front-end technologies. I think you're really smart, and you were able to get projects up and running without having a sensei to run to like me! I know I always get off track, and I always goof off while you're explaining things to me. So, I really do appreciate your patience.
    <br />
    <br />I hope one day, I'll be able to help you understand something too! So, feel free to ask me, but usually I most likely won't know... I wish you the best of luck, and if you're ever down to study or work on a project, you're welcome to come pester me!
    </p>, 
    "istilloweapicture":<p>Happy Easter, Felix!
    <br />
    <br />Sorry for dropping off the face of the planet. I think I have a FB message that I forgot to respond to...
    <br />
    <br />But anyways, I'm still around! I've just started to work on a lot more projects on my spare time. I hope you're doing well! I know I still owe you a picture. I recall that you wanted a girl with ribbons as your picture. You sure you don't want a picture of a guy? I've been referencing the characters from Free!! so they can be really pretty and... uh... manly?
    <br />
    <br />Anyways, just thought I'd express my appreciation to you for being such a good friend. I'm not very good at keeping in contact with people, but you make an honest effort to keep in contact with me even though I'm no longer living in the same city anymore. You were also the one that introduced the Persona series to me and also got me to pick up the Madolche deck.
    <br />
    <br />Thanks to your recommendations, I was able to have a lot of fun! The SMT series is my favorite series out of all the games right now, and it was all thanks to you for introducing Persona to me. I'm always such a troll, and it's fun messing with people. I appreciate that you put up with that.
    <br />
    <br />I'm also still waiting on the finished video! You went and filmed THE GREAT ME, so I'm excited to see the outcome. Of course, take your time. Quality is important, and you have other things to take care of too. Also, I still have a picture that I still owe you, so I shouldn't be the one to be demanding.
    <br />
    <br />Anyways, I'm finished sending you my message, and I hope to be getting some sleep soon! Talk to you later~</p>, 
    "seestah":<p>Happy Easter, Christa! I miss you so much! It feels so long ago since I last hung out with you!
    <br />
    <br />I want to be able to watch anime with you again! I can't believe you got me to watch so many episodes of Naruto! The episode where he's talking to his dad's spirit made me cryyyyyy. I still remember that anime you showed us with the horrible dub. It was so bad that I even remember the first line.
    <br />
    <br />"I'M SOOOOO ANGRY GUUUUUUYYYSSS!!!" But I can see why you like it. If maybe you showed us something other than the English dub, I think maybe you could have gotten us to be more cooperative since the story was pretty good. 
    <br />
    <br />But if there's one thing I regret, it's not being able to play a drinking game with you! They always looked so fun, but I'd always cap out before people would start playing games! Next time I come visit, I'll be sure to pester for another drink day with everyone! </p>, 
    "hernameisellie":<p>Happy Easter, Hannah! I hope all is well for you!
    <br />
    <br />As you can see, all my time went into making this website and this Easter thing that I still deployed late. Some things never change right? ; v;
    <br />
    <br />But I wanted to say that I'm glad that I met you! We started out just having like 3 classes with each other and since we would both come early, we naturally started to talk to each other. You have practically dragged me through all of university with you.
    <br />
    <br />Honestly, thank you for being there for me. I had many times where I just really didn't know what I was doing, and then you'd appear and just explain everything to me. Although, I remember when we were supposed to be studying but we drew a map of Anchorage instead. We definitely had a lot of fun along the way.
    <br />
    <br />You were also there for me when I was having a hard time, and you were also the ones giving me rides if I was too terrified to drive around in the snow. Thanks to you introducing Bailieys/Ryans to me, I didn't think drinking alcohol was so bad from time to time. You've honestly helped me chill out a bit more on some things, and step out of my comfort zone on others.
    <br />
    <br />And thank you so much for the dress that you bought me! It got pretty cold in California, so I wore it a lot because it was one of the few long sleeves I had! Although, I really shouldn't be complaining about the cold to someone in Alaska. LOL. Also, my cousin really liked the style too. 
    <br />
    <br />I'm glad to have you as a friend! I may be terrible at keeping in contact, but I at least try to ping people I like every other month if they're not pinging me first! </p>, 
    "bestmentor":<p>Happy Easter, Ate Erin! Hopefully your Easter was amazing, and that you had fun at those conferences!
    <br />
    <br />While I'm at it, I just wanted to write a little appreciation letter to you~ I met you by pure coincidence since I went to go check out a WWC event, but I am so glad that I did! You are one of my role models that I aspire to be like. Your passions and your achievements are such an inspiration, and despite being busy with your own agenda, you still take the time to give back to the community.
    <br />
    <br />You remind me where my confidence should be at, and that I should value my work more than I do. Thanks for looking out for me and keeping me updated with events that you think I'd be interested in, and I appreciate all that you're doing for me! </p>, 
    "thankyouate":<p>Happy Easter, Ate Marj! You can get to see what I've been working on all week! It's not much, but I'll keep practicing until I can come up with something better! I hope you're having fun in London right now. I'm not even sure if you'll even be able to see this on Easter day since I deployed it so late. 
    <br />
    <br />While I've been sending sappy messages to all my friends, I'm sending one to you too! Since I got to California, you've been supporting me, and got to see my ups and downs... and there has been mostly downs. You always give me good advice, and thanks to you, my sloppy habits are slowly but surely changing. 
    <br />
    <br />Just wanted to thank you for putting up with me and hopefully I'll find work soon so I can be the one to treat you out to food! 
    <br />
    <br />Anyways, have fun on the rest of your trip. Now that I have finished this project, I will be in spring cleaning mode~ Wheee~</p>, 
    "thebros":<p>Hi! Happy Easter guys! 
    <br />
    <br />Just thought I'd give you guys a quick Easter shout out, and thank you guys for always taking me out around San Francisco. Thanks to you all, I have a palette for ramen now, so I can't just eat crappy ramen and feel satisfied anymore! Sorry for always pestering to go out and eat! The food in San Francisco is so good! 
    <br />
    <br />But next time, maybe we should try doing an escape room together! I think that'll be fun! I always pester to eat, but going out to do something fun is nice! Or if you guys want to try going to a rock climbing gym, I'm down for that too! We don't have to, but I'm just throwing random suggestions out there. 
    <br />
    <br />Anyways, have a good rest of your day! Thanks for reading!</p>,
    "4everwatching":<p>Happy Easter everyone! I'm glad you can all make it to read my Easter greetings to you, and I can show off what I've been making!
    <br />
    <br />Gotta say, sorry it's a little sloppy, but I had Easter as a deadline, and I was still learning the technologies. Anyways, wanted to say a heartfelt thank you to all of you guys for making my time during college really fun. We were such an infamous group at Cuddy, and I loved playing cardgames with such a big group. ERS with Laura was soooooo fun when I'm on a sugar high!
    <br />
    <br />I also had a lot of fun at our group hangouts! Thank you to Jon for always hosting! We wouldn't have a place to be loud and crazy without you, and I really appreciate it! RIP the box where everyone would sleep though. I wonder if it's been replaced?
    <br />
    <br />Anyways, it's been forever since I've seen you guys since I'm not there. I miss everyone since the people around me aren't as crazy or like the same things. It's been a long time since I even played card games. ; v;
    <br />
    <br />I hope all of you are well! I'll work hard and save up so I can come and visit again!</p>,
