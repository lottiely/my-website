            description: <p>For an assignment in my machine learning elective, I developed a spam classifier using the Naive Bayesian Classifier algorithm in Java to classify spam and non-spam emails. Classifier used words as features to determine spam or non-spam.
            <br />
            <br />
            This was done by taking a dataset containing spam and non-spam and their features as input. The dataset was then separated into a training set and a classification set.
            <br />
            <br />
            Accuracy and precision rates consistently ranged over 90%. Distributions between the training and classification sets were altered, and it was found that higher accuracy and precision resulted from a higher distribution in the training set.
